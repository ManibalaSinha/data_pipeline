# Data Pipeline Project

A Python-based ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline that automates data ingestion, transformation, and storage. Designed to demonstrate real-world data engineering workflows.

---

##  Motivation

In modern applications, raw data comes in different formats and sources. This project simulates a scalable ETL workflow that processes raw data, transforms it into a structured format, and stores it in a database for analysis or downstream applications.

---

##  Features

- Automated data ingestion from CSV files or APIs  
- Data cleaning, transformation, and normalization  
- Loading processed data into PostgreSQL or SQLite  
- Logging and error handling for reliability  
- Modular and easily extensible pipeline  

---

##  Tech Stack

- **Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** pandas, SQLAlchemy, requests  
- **Database:** PostgreSQL / SQLite  
- **Optional Tools:** Docker, GitHub Actions (CI/CD)

##  Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ManibalaSinha/data_pipeline.git
````

2. Navigate into the project folder:

   ```bash
   cd data_pipeline
   ```
3. Create a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```
4. Activate the environment:

   * Windows:

     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   * Mac/Linux:

     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```
5. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
6. Run the pipeline:

   ```bash
   python etl_main.py
   ```

##  Future Enhancements

* Integrate **Apache Airflow** or **Prefect** for pipeline scheduling* Add **unit and integration tests** to ensure reliability
* Enable **API-based data ingestion** from live sources
* Implement **Dockerization** for easier deployment
